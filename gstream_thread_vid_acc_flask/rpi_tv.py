accelerometer: outputs 0 when object in freefall and -g when at rest (static)
 Accelerometers are used to sense both static (e.g. gravity) and dynamic (e.g. sudden starts/stops) acceleration. 
 They donâ€™t need to be tracked and can measure the current angle at any given time. 
 Accelerometers however are very noisy and are only useful for tracking angles over a long period of time.
